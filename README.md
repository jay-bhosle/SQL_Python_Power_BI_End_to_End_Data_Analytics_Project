# SQL, Python & Power BI End-to-End Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This repository showcases a complete data-analytics pipeline for a global electronics retailer. It includes:
- SQL scripts for extracting and shaping data.
- A Python notebook for exploratory analysis and metrics.
- A Power BI report for interactive dashboards.
- A written project report and the original assignment brief.

## Repository contents
- `1.SQL.sql` — SQL queries for data preparation and analysis.
- `2.Python.ipynb` — Python analysis notebook.
- `3.Power BI.pbix` — Power BI report file.
- `Project Report.pdf` — Narrative write-up and findings.
- `Assignment.txt` — Problem statement and analysis prompts.

## Key questions addressed
- What products does the company sell, and where are customers located?
- What seasonal patterns or trends exist in order volume or revenue?
- How long is the average delivery time, and how has it changed?
- Is average order value different for online vs. in-store sales?

## How to use
1. Review the SQL in `1.SQL.sql` to understand data extraction and transformations.
2. Open `2.Python.ipynb` to reproduce analysis and calculations.
3. Load `3.Power BI.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.
4. Read `Project Report.pdf` for the summary and conclusions.

## Requirements
- Power BI Desktop (for `.pbix`).
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab (for `.ipynb`).
- A SQL environment compatible with the SQL script.
