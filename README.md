# End-to-End Data Analytics Project (SQL, Python, Power BI)

## Overview
This repository contains an end-to-end data analytics workflow that spans:
- **SQL** for data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Python** for analysis, exploration, and automation.
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and reporting.

The project artifacts are:
- `1.SQL.sql` — SQL scripts for data preparation.
- `2.Python.ipynb` — Python notebook for analysis.
- `3.Power BI.pbix` — Power BI report file.
- `Assignment.txt` and `Project Report.pdf` — supporting documentation.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL**: Data querying, joins, aggregations, and transformation logic.
- **Python**: Data analysis, visualization, and workflow automation.
- **Power BI**: Dashboarding and interactive reporting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive analysis environment for Python.
- **SQL (scripts in `1.SQL.sql`)**
  - Data extraction, cleaning, joins, aggregations, and transformation logic.
  - Creates analysis-ready datasets for downstream workflows.
- **Python (notebook in `2.Python.ipynb`)**
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA), data validation, and feature exploration.
  - Automation-friendly analysis steps for repeatable insights.
- **Power BI (report in `3.Power BI.pbix`)**
  - Interactive dashboards, KPIs, and drill-down reporting.
  - Presentation-ready visuals for stakeholder consumption.
- **Jupyter Notebook**
  - Interactive environment for documenting analysis and results.

## Achievements & Results
- **Integrated data pipeline** from extraction to visualization across SQL, Python, and Power BI.
- **Reproducible analysis** with a structured SQL script and a notebook-based workflow.
- **Business-ready reporting** delivered through a Power BI dashboard.
- **Project documentation** included for transparency and handoff.
- **End-to-end analytics workflow** implemented across SQL, Python, and Power BI.
- **Clean, analysis-ready data** produced through documented SQL transformations.
- **Validated insights** surfaced through Python EDA and structured analysis steps.
- **Decision-ready reporting** delivered via Power BI dashboards and KPIs.
- **Complete handoff artifacts** (SQL, notebook, report, and documentation) for reproducibility.

## How to Use
1. Review the SQL logic in `1.SQL.sql` to understand data preparation.
2. Run the Python analysis in `2.Python.ipynb`.
3. Open `3.Power BI.pbix` in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.
